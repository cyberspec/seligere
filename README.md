A consensus algorithm in the most general form is a method in which decentralized nodes (e.g., computers, virtual machines, devices) come to an agreement on what data is added to a digital ledger. Consensus algorithms are often conceptually related to defeating the Byzantine Generals’ problem: How can multiple generals agree on a plan of attack without being able to reliably communicate with each other while having possible traitors sending false messages?

This can be done with something less resource-intensive than Proof of Work, something more balanced than Proof of Stake, something without a centralized coordinating process (Tangle Coordinator), and something that is not proprietary (Swirlds). Proposed instead is Proof of Selection, which involves building a digital ledger with an agreed upon method of ‘selecting’ the next nodes to create a block. A consensus is pre-determined; it is akin to planning a time to attack or retreating and defining a method of detecting traitors before being separated and going to the battlefield.

Problem set 1: Define a new open source consensus algorithm called Proof of Selection that does not require mining, has equal block publishing rights that are not based on stake, and no centralized coordinating processes.

Problem set 2: Provide a new digital ledger technology, called Seligere, based on Proof of Selection to achieve a more efficient method of decentralized currency, storage, data transactions, and research. Allowing nodes the ability to customize processing and storage usage is like to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
